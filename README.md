# Project Name - Ping Touring Service

Ping Touring Services is an application that offers customizable tours for anyone:
1) It allows tourists to choose their start and end location for a tour
2) It allows tourists to choose the level of excitement for a tour

# Installation

To be able to run our program, make sure to have:
- A python programming language
- Libraries: import heapq

To download the libary, type:
import heapq

Now that we have the required libraries set up, open the file named "PING algorithm.py" and run the program.

# Usage



# Some Extra Information About the Code

In order to create our algorithm, we used the following data structures:
- weighted graphs

We also used the following algorithms:
- Dijkstra's algorithm

We also created an excel that has all the resources needed to create our program. The file can be openeed above, it is named "PING Resources.xltx"
In the excel, you will find the ten locations in Segovia used for the program, the time usually spent at each location, and the time it takes from a
location to another.
