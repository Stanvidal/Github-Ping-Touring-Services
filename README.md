# Project Name - Ping Touring Service

Ping Touring Services is an application that offers customizable tours for anyone:
1) It allows tourists to choose their start and end location for a tour
2) It allows tourists to choose the level of excitement for a tour

# Installation

To be able to run our program, make sure to have:
- A python programming language: We used on a macbook. We also used pycharm as our programming environment.
- Libraries: heapq

To download the libary, type:
import heapq

Now that we have the required libraries set up, open the file named "PING algorithm.py" and run the program.

# Usage

Once a user enters our platform, they are asked to input three things: 
1) the start location of their tour.
2) the end location of their tour. 
3) the level of adventure they want their tour to be on a scale from 1 to 10.

The user is then given the following output: 
The user will be given a list of loactions to go to in order based on the input he gave. The list is in order from start to finish. They are also given the total amount of time it takes to travel between these locations, and the total amount of time they are estimated to spend at the locations.

The program currently only works for Segovia, but hopefully we will later on expand to different and bigger cities.

# Some Extra Information About the Code

In order to create our algorithm, we used the following data structures:
- weighted graphs

We also used the following algorithms:
- Dijkstra's algorithm

We also created an excel that has all the resources needed to create our program. The file can be openeed above, it is named "PING Resources.xltx"
In the excel, you will find the ten locations in Segovia used for the program, the time usually spent at each location, and the time it takes from a
location to another.
